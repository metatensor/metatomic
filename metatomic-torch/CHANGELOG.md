<!-- Possible sections for each package:

## [Version 0.1.4](https://github.com/metatensor/metatomic/releases/tag/metatomic-torch-v0.1.4) - 2025-09-11

### Added

- The code is now compatible with metatensor-torch v0.8.0
- The code is now compatible torch v2.8

- `System.to` accepts a `non_blocking` argument, with the same meaning as
  `torch.Tensor.to`.
- The ASE `MetatomicCalculator` will now send warnings if the model predicts a
  high per-atom uncertainty for its energy output.
- We now have two new standard outputs: `positions` and `momenta`, which can be
  used for direct structure prediction and bypassing time integration.

## [Version 0.1.3](https://github.com/metatensor/metatomic/releases/tag/metatomic-torch-v0.1.3) - 2025-07-25

### Fixed

- The logic to detect OpenMP dependencies in TorchScript extensions now takes
  into account the user's site-package directory (#65)
- `metatomic.torch.ase_calculator` is now lazy-loaded, and can be accessed
  directly after importing `metatomic.torch` (#59)

## [Version 0.1.2](https://github.com/metatensor/metatomic/releases/tag/metatomic-torch-v0.1.2) - 2025-06-06

### Fixed

- `register_autograd_neighbors` is now kept in the code by the TorchScript
  compiler. It was previously silently removed.
- When running `ase_calculator.Metatomic` with `non_conservative=True`, we no
  longer crash for NPT simulations.


## [Version 0.1.1](https://github.com/metatensor/metatomic/releases/tag/metatomic-torch-v0.1.1) - 2025-05-20

### Fixed

- `metatomic_torch` can now be built as part of the same cmake project as
  `metatensor` and `metatensor_torch` (#33)


## [Version 0.1.0](https://github.com/metatensor/metatomic/releases/tag/metatomic-torch-v0.1.0) - 2025-05-05

The first release of metatomic-torch, containing code for atomisitic model
extracted out of [metatensor-torch v0.7.5](https://github.com/metatensor/metatensor/releases/tag/metatensor-torch-v0.7.5), with the following additional changes:

- Renamed `MetatensorAtomisticModel` to `AtomisticModel`
- Renamed `MetatensorCalculator` in the ASE interface to `MetatomicCalculator`
