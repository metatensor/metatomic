``metatomic`` is a library that defines a common interface between atomistic
machine learning models, and atomistic simulation engines. Our main goal is to
define and train models once, and then be able to re-use them across many
different simulation engines (such as LAMMPS, PLUMED, *etc.*). We strive to
achieve this goal without imposing any structure on the model itself, and to
allow any model architecture to be used.

This library focuses on exporting and importing fully working, already trained
models. If you want to train existing architectures with new data or re-use
existing trained models, look into the metatrain_ project instead.

        Why should you use ``metatomic`` to define and export your model? What is
        the point of the interface? How can you use models that follow the
        interface in your own simulation code?

        All these questions and more will be answered in this overview!
