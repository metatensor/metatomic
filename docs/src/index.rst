Equistore
=========

Equistore is a specialized data storage format for all your atomistic machine
learning needs, and more. Think numpy ``ndarray`` or pytorch ``Tensor`` equipped
with extra metadata for atomic — and other particles — systems. The core of this
library is written in Rust and we provide API for C, C++, and Python.

The main class of equistore is the :py:class:`equistore.TensorMap` data
structure. This class defines a block-sparse data format, where each
:py:class:`block <equistore.TensorBlock>` is stored using `coordinate-sparse`_
storage. The schematic below represents a TensorMap made of multiple
TensorBlocks, and the overall data format is explained further in the
:ref:`getting started <userdoc-core-concepts>` section of this documentation. If
you are using equistore from Python, we additionally provide a collection of
mathematical, logical and other utility :ref:`operations
<python-api-operations>` to make working with TensorMaps more convenient.

Why equistore
-------------

With the creation of equistore, we want to achieve three goals:

1. provide an interchange format for the atomistic machine learning ecosystem,
   making different players in this ecosystem more interoperable with one
   another;
2. make it easier and faster to prototype new machine learning representations,
   models and algorithms applied to atomistic modeling;
3. run large scale simulations using machine learning interatomic potentials,
   with fully customizable potentials, directly defined by the researchers
   running the simulations.

For more information on these goals and how we are trying to fulfill them,
please read the corresponding :ref:`documentation page <userdoc-goals>`.
Equistore is still in the alpha phase of software development, so expect some
rough corners and sharp edges.
