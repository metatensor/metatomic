Metatensor
==========

Metatensor is a specialized data storage format for all your atomistic machine
learning needs, and more. Think numpy ``ndarray`` or pytorch ``Tensor`` equipped
with extra metadata for atomic ‚Äî and other particles ‚Äî systems.

        Learn about the core goals of metatensor, and what the library is about:

        - an exchange format for ML data;
        - a prototyping tool for new models;
        - an interface for atomistic simulations.
