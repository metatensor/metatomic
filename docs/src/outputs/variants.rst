Output variants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Models can provide multiple *variants* of the same output, for example different
exchangeâ€“correlation functionals for the energy. Variants allow you to select which
"head" of the model to use in downstream engines and workflows.

Variants are identified by appending ``"/<variant>"`` to the base output name. For
example:

- ``energy`` (default)
- ``energy/pbe0``
- ``energy/r2scan``

If a model defines one or more variants, it **must also define the default base output**
(e.g. ``energy``). Both the default and its variants follow the same :ref:`output
metadata <atomistic-models-outputs>` rules.

The following simulation engines currently support output variants:

.. grid:: 1 3 3 3

  .. grid-item-card::
