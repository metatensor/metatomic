.. _metatensor-learn:

Learning utilities
==================

One important target application for the metatensor data format is its usage in
machine learning models. This submodule contains building blocks and utilities
that facilitate the construction and training of such models, for both the
standard and TorchScript backends of metatensor.

This part of the code is still in it's early days, and will be improved as we go!
