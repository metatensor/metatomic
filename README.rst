Equistore
=========

|test| |docs|

Equistore is a specialized data storage format suited to all your atomistic
machine learning needs and more (think ``numpy`` or ``torch.Tensor``, but also
carrying extra metadata for atomistic systems).

The core of the library is written in Rust and we provide APIs for C/C++ and
Python as well.

For details, tutorials, and examples, please have a look at our `documentation`_.
